        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C)
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.
